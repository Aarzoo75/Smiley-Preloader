# Smiley Preloader
This is a simple and fun preloader animation that can be used on websites to indicate that content is being loaded. The animation features a smiling face with rotating eyes and a blinking right eye, and a mouth that opens and closes. The colors of the preloader can be customized by changing the --hue variable in the CSS.

## How to Use
To use the Smiley Preloader, simply copy the HTML and CSS code into your web page. The HTML code includes an SVG element that contains the smiley face, and the CSS code defines the styles and animations for the smiley face.
